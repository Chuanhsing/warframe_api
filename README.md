# Warframe API Python Library

Access your in-game data using the same API that the official Warframe Android app uses.

See `extractors.py` for an example of how you might use it.

**Note**: This has only been tested with Python 3.5. It probably won't work with Python 2.x.

## Installaton

Either clone this repository and run: `python setup.py install`

Or through pip: `pip3 install git+http://github.com/cephalon-sofis/warframe_api.git`
